00:00:33.218 --> 00:00:33.808
What's the matter?

00:00:47.198 --> 00:00:48.478
The guy's a very great aunt.

00:00:58.838 --> 00:01:00.588
when he mumbled good.

00:01:01.858 --> 00:01:02.018

00:01:04.918 --> 00:01:05.608
You're gonna miss him.

00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:06.788
We buried her.

00:01:06.798 --> 00:01:07.448
Not here,

00:01:08.438 --> 00:01:10.548
i think is still missing.

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:12.688
I don't care if he was a bull.

00:01:16.138 --> 00:01:19.918
What done after reflected all again.

00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:27.868
Oh,

00:01:28.798 --> 00:01:29.158
then 

00:01:34.738 --> 00:01:35.148
i can't.

00:01:39.038 --> 00:01:39.548
Men,

00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:41.218

00:01:44.058 --> 00:01:44.188
No,

00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:44.448
they 

00:01:51.498 --> 00:01:52.198
having a rest.

00:01:54.338 --> 00:01:55.038
What we're having for dinner.

00:01:56.638 --> 00:01:57.678
I feel looks,

00:01:57.828 --> 00:01:58.458

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.940
You what?

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.900
I can tell you.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.330
Come on.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.070
But he went.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.140
What about you,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.780

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.630
There,

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.110

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.560
You'll be under way before one more.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.740
It's a mother's baraka here.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.370
It looks nice.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.730
One in the bathroom as you used to.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.150
Just because he does something.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.920
I used something.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.640
Do you have to?

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.650
Here's what?

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.690
It's all the same.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.690
Tiny shampoo.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.070
And what about my condition?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.070
Is absolutely none of that left a special being.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.730
What have been washing the dog in that give?

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.220
Weather.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.100
And now back to you,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.300
john.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.240
Well,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.830
thanks very much,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.070
benny.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.090
And that's what we have a new sport and weather.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:17.630
Settle back now,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.800
finding the time.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.530
When have i should say anyway?

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.630
It's typical way.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.750
Have lovely conversations.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.070
Don't way can't hear my mistake.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.930
Death king of death.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.210
Of course not.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.130
She's not dead.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.070
No,

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.410
mr cupid hearing is not as good as he used to be,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.670
but i wouldn't describe you as deaf.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.270
Not by any means.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.500
Evidently,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.630
a lot of people don't golly what people are saying.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.260
Even i don't hear as well as i used.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.140
Whatever ringing in me work like a slave taking out the distance that you think 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.690
your wreck and i'm not there.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.730
You want a second opinion?

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:42.230
What's the verdict?

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.530
Good.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.490
You no longer hear sounds.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.230
And the other people.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.820
That's what's making it difficult for you to follow conversations.

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.329
Thanks.

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.029
You think it's too late for that?

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:55.019
You can stop getting any worse,

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:58.329
but you can't improve the noise.

00:05:58.919 --> 00:05:59.369
Yes,

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:00.129
twenty years of it.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:01.659
You're the only one.

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:03.129
It's a major epidemic,

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.719
mr cooper.

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:06.599
Thousands of people like you are suffering from noise.

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:06.829
Death?

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:09.549
Can i never stop getting anywhere?

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:12.729
Get that company of yours to do something about it.

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:14.039
On the other hand,

00:06:14.049 --> 00:06:15.929
i know a company that's done something about it.

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:19.129
Make an appointment for you to see the personnel.

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:20.109
No,

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:22.219
no,

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:22.529
thanks.

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:25.639
Don't worry about it.

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:26.429
I'll see what i can do.

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:32.989
The he reckons he knows affected.

00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:35.329
That has done something about yeah,

00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:38.239
you're going to get the year and you two doing worry,

00:06:38.239 --> 00:06:38.449
mike,

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:39.229
we're on good money.

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:44.199
Can't save people's ears by given the money it hasn't helped make.

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:44.969
Crikey.

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.119
Then you've been even twenty years like a song and dance about it.

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:49.639
Of course,

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.429
i only just found out what a bloody minded under me.

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:54.139
You want us to do something about it.

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:55.419
You kind of need proof now.

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:56.289
Am i supposed to get that?

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:57.079
That's your problem.

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:58.579
Then you brought up the subject.

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:14.129
I'm looking for some information,

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:16.229
bail noise.

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:19.579
And what happens to your ears when you get too much of it?

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:20.839
What?

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:24.129
Quiet.

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:36.639
Hey!

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:47.979
Yeah.

00:07:51.628 --> 00:07:51.758
Yeah,

00:07:53.658 --> 00:07:54.678
we have you to do in bed.

00:08:20.128 --> 00:08:20.188
Yeah.

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:32.738
Yeah.

00:08:44.128 --> 00:08:44.788
What do you think of that?

00:08:46.478 --> 00:08:48.578
Might be all right.

00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:50.098
Might be.

00:08:53.468 --> 00:08:54.968
We all know the machines and noisy men.

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:55.938
But you blokes get paid.

00:08:55.948 --> 00:08:56.418
Good money,

00:08:56.598 --> 00:08:57.048
karen.

00:08:57.048 --> 00:08:58.518
Extent he's got up in the lunchroom.

00:08:59.128 --> 00:08:59.838
Pretty frightening.

00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:00.098
Now,

00:09:00.108 --> 00:09:00.898
don't you start on me,

00:09:00.898 --> 00:09:01.238
mike.

00:09:02.028 --> 00:09:04.218
We've been putting up warnings from the safety section for years.

00:09:04.218 --> 00:09:04.998
A lot of notice.

00:09:04.998 --> 00:09:05.438
They take it,

00:09:06.128 --> 00:09:10.758
but you've gotta really confess people hearing is suffering before they'll do anything 

00:09:10.758 --> 00:09:11.228
about it.

00:09:11.488 --> 00:09:14.418
You can't just pick up buddy a star on a wall.

00:09:14.498 --> 00:09:15.268
Union's happy,

00:09:15.268 --> 00:09:15.508
isn't it?

00:09:16.628 --> 00:09:18.088
What you seem to forget is it?

00:09:18.098 --> 00:09:19.168
Without that machine of yours,

00:09:19.168 --> 00:09:23.078
you'll be without a job without in a prepared to put up with that noise.

00:09:23.078 --> 00:09:24.648
You ever got our factory.

00:09:24.718 --> 00:09:26.938
But i've got the factory and i've got the blokes.

00:09:27.438 --> 00:09:28.008
You show him.

00:09:29.088 --> 00:09:30.758
Go open it.

00:09:32.068 --> 00:09:35.888
Meaning well,

00:09:36.088 --> 00:09:36.968
someone better,

00:09:36.988 --> 00:09:37.248
man,

00:09:37.538 --> 00:09:39.648
because i only just found that money.

00:09:40.728 --> 00:09:42.638
Find a company that stump something about.

00:09:46.838 --> 00:09:49.168
The old machine might enough noise to wake the dead.

00:09:50.128 --> 00:09:51.308
Time can replace it.

00:09:51.418 --> 00:09:55.238
Call craft decided to make sure that design covered the noisy world.

00:09:56.648 --> 00:09:57.378
Nothing worked.

00:09:58.118 --> 00:09:58.838
What makes you different?

00:09:59.228 --> 00:10:00.328
We all sleep a little better.

00:10:06.728 --> 00:10:08.258
Like wait.

00:10:15.028 --> 00:10:18.448
Most of the other machines just needed modified to make noise.

00:10:23.808 --> 00:10:26.238
Sometimes i loathe sound.

00:10:26.728 --> 00:10:27.578
Not that expected,

00:10:27.588 --> 00:10:28.838
but you really notice the difference.

00:10:38.908 --> 00:10:39.198
God,

00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:40.428
that more problems here.

00:10:41.528 --> 00:10:42.238
So be it.

00:10:43.438 --> 00:10:48.128
Got some quiet your equipment on all over america that's my merchant like they wear him out 

00:10:50.028 --> 00:10:52.258
on the ready line all their world.

00:10:54.628 --> 00:10:59.238
But the best way by firing two detectives were really start in the machine 

00:11:00.428 --> 00:11:04.438
that's playing here beyond real while solving the problem.

00:11:08.628 --> 00:11:10.478
That's part of why we're here.

00:11:11.858 --> 00:11:12.558
How did that happen?

00:11:12.788 --> 00:11:13.298
Amazement.

00:11:13.308 --> 00:11:13.618
Call it.

00:11:13.628 --> 00:11:15.418
They're hearing conservation programme.

00:11:15.858 --> 00:11:18.338
Proud of stop.

00:11:19.328 --> 00:11:20.038
Took a while.

00:11:20.528 --> 00:11:22.738
Some of the blokes complained about the noise in the yard.

00:11:23.228 --> 00:11:26.538
I've got the brass to issue him up to everyone that didn't do much good.

00:11:27.628 --> 00:11:30.618
So then the union got behind the idea and they invited the near expert.

00:11:31.528 --> 00:11:32.338
Really shook everyone up.

00:11:33.108 --> 00:11:33.788
You have made the death.

00:11:33.788 --> 00:11:34.338
I continue.

00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:37.138
So we got the expert to talk to them.

00:11:37.628 --> 00:11:38.338
That shook him up.

00:11:38.828 --> 00:11:41.908
The ball's started running a bloody big difference.

00:11:41.908 --> 00:11:44.158
I can't hear you don't want a lot heavier.

00:11:47.128 --> 00:11:47.318
You know,

00:11:47.318 --> 00:11:50.038
you should talk to that hearing you're looking for.

00:11:50.728 --> 00:11:50.978
Yeah,

00:11:50.978 --> 00:11:51.338
i know.

00:11:52.228 --> 00:11:53.388
You could always come work for us.

00:12:02.728 --> 00:12:03.038

00:12:05.628 --> 00:12:09.048
I appreciate what you do together.

00:12:09.278 --> 00:12:10.338
Might come sit up on titan.

00:12:11.378 --> 00:12:12.988
We're changing your intervention.

00:12:14.528 --> 00:12:15.328
I don't have anyone.

00:12:16.328 --> 00:12:17.578
I don't hear too well myself.

00:12:19.128 --> 00:12:19.528

00:12:19.528 --> 00:12:20.338

Yeah,

00:12:24.128 --> 00:12:24.338

You did.

00:12:28.288 --> 00:12:28.938
They're free.

00:12:29.948 --> 00:12:32.838
Let me everybody guiding help.

00:12:33.228 --> 00:12:34.248
Revenues are half wit.

00:12:35.428 --> 00:12:35.938
Stick with it.

00:12:36.728 --> 00:12:37.098
I'm glad.

00:12:37.098 --> 00:12:40.338
Something twenty years they're gonna be like that.

00:12:52.928 --> 00:12:54.338
Sure you could do something about it.

00:12:54.828 --> 00:12:55.138
Well,

00:12:56.028 --> 00:13:00.938
tried telling them give to lose because you're telling him yourself.

00:13:06.098 --> 00:13:10.898
They used to wear that said he got hit the other kids ravished even that 

00:13:10.898 --> 00:13:12.738
maxie didn't mother anymore.

00:13:13.088 --> 00:13:17.438
What if i brought in an expert to talk to him on the management wouldn't like it.

00:13:18.498 --> 00:13:21.268
What if we put it down to an educational lecture?

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:24.248
They might go along with it.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.170
What's the healthy here?

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.450
Those little white things are extremely tiny hair cells that changed the sounds 

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.270
into any chronic impulses that are sent to the brain.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.060
If they're damaged,

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.970
you stop here.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.500
This is what they look like.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:49.230
Then they've been exposed to the same sort of sound conditions as you have in this factory.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:50.970
You look too good do that.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.140
But that's only over a short period to convince you to get the union back there.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:56.270
Uh,

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:57.570
okay.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.170
What happens to the hair cells over a longer period?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.400
They're dead.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.570
Quite dead.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.470
Killed off by son.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.320
Now,

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.950
there's no ifs or buts in this.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.510
If you work in noise,

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.170
you'll go death.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.010
You leave your ears unprotected even for ten minutes a day.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.570
In a few years time you're hearing will suffer.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.170
It's a simple as that.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.540
I just believe that i think we don't like to think the audiologist 

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:35.770
and minutes,

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:36.770
right.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.880
Just have a deputation of apprentices in here.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.870
Let that pretty stood up.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.790
Worried about the noise?

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.270
I don't suppose that's got anything to do with you.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.870
I improved in educational lecture ofyour bloody cross there.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.570
Write me off as a crank in your life,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.170
not you.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:07.870
Well,

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:08.380
well,

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.370
i'm inclined to agree with you.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.070
Well,

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.860
what we gonna do about one?

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.470
The noise you started all this well.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.670
First you could organize a noise survey of the whole factory to identify the problem areas.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:26.920
You could bring the next,

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.970
but back in to talk to women job.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.020
Well,

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.860
i was thinking you could close the plant down from afternoon lunch 

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.850
survey in the lunch hour.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:40.960
That's enough for one day after that.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.050
No promises whatsoever,

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:42.470
okay?

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.820
It's like we've got a lunch date.

00:15:49.106 --> 00:15:49.166
No.

00:15:49.906 --> 00:15:53.746
What i want to know is did you pick up the gun pretty clearly.

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.816
That was last year.

00:16:03.706 --> 00:16:06.916
Got the japanese to design change course.

00:16:07.806 --> 00:16:08.016
Come on.

00:16:09.506 --> 00:16:09.576
No,

00:16:11.356 --> 00:16:12.016
where we're at.

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:13.086
Well,

00:16:13.266 --> 00:16:16.616
we'll get one that runs a bit quiet when that was made.

00:16:19.196 --> 00:16:22.186
So the japanese could you make one that run about ninety,

00:16:23.506 --> 00:16:24.316
still very noisy.

00:16:26.606 --> 00:16:30.986
Time goes by and bras well.

00:16:35.246 --> 00:16:35.576
Riley,

00:16:35.576 --> 00:16:37.406
this japanese turns up and he says,

00:16:37.416 --> 00:16:38.616
are you?

00:16:39.246 --> 00:16:39.336
Yeah.

00:16:40.306 --> 00:16:41.316
Happening is sorry.

00:16:41.326 --> 00:16:43.246
Carry on,

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:45.086
cando.

00:16:46.536 --> 00:16:50.316
This is what a machine that runs on ninety.

00:16:52.506 --> 00:16:52.656
No.

00:16:55.496 --> 00:16:55.696
Oh,

00:16:55.696 --> 00:16:56.096
yes,

00:16:57.796 --> 00:16:58.686
all our machines.

00:16:58.686 --> 00:17:00.296
One of eighty five decibels.

00:17:00.296 --> 00:17:01.756
Very difficult to make a front.

00:17:01.756 --> 00:17:02.346
Any noisy?

00:17:02.346 --> 00:17:02.526
Yeah,

00:17:05.116 --> 00:17:05.376
jeff.

00:17:06.926 --> 00:17:07.366
And again,

00:17:08.306 --> 00:17:08.686
mr.

00:17:27.606 --> 00:17:27.666
No.

00:17:27.606 --> 00:17:27.666
