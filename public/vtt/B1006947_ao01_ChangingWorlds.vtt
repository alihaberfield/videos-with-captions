00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.730
Yeah.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.630
I was born in vietnam,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.260
one of ten children.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.930
My parents fled china to saigon.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.830
When multitude came into power,

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.030
they built a very successful business.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.320
But in nineteen seventy five,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.610
the communists took control ofthe saigon in our lives changed 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.530
forever.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.780
My father was interrogated and all his ss is 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.320
we were persecuted for being chinese and wealthy were had to 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.930
survive by selling or our belongings.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.750
In nineteen seventy five,

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.830
i married and had two beautiful children.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.770
Why my several attempts to escape the health that was i 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.570
gone my father,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.130
mother and youngest brother,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.100
fletcher to taiwan in nineteen seventy nine.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.920
We escaped on a small boat cramped with three hundred seventy 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.870
five others.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.930
We were as safe for five days when the boat sank.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.760
Fortunately,

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.640
we were rescued and health as of refugees in chinese bamboo 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.030
hunts on an island in indonesia.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.130
It was like living in a concentration camp,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.180
but thankfully,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.920
my children and sisters gave me the strength to survive.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.120
Eleven months later,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.120
we gained residency in australia after a 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.930
year in hostel with settle in kensington,

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.730
i've wanted as an interpreter at my kid's school.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.730
Twenty three years later,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.430
i'm still there as a bilingual texas system and the lover.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.580
Settling in a new country has its hardships.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.630
My husband and i drifted apart and i missed my mother.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.530
It was heartbreaking not being with her when she was dying.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.530
But australia has given me lots of opportunities.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.830
I'm so proud of my children's of achievements 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.830
and was so happy when my father and brother joined us.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.430
I have also met the love of my life king 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.430
in two thousand four.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.920
Can an ivory change this icon?

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.530
This was the first time back since skyping 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.170
the trip was very emotional,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.830
but it helped make clothes a difficult chapter off my life.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.540
On valentine's day this year,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.070
ken and i were engaged.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.720
So now i start a whole new journey.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.720
