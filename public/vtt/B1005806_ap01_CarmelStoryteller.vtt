00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:17.778
Camel has always loved a good story.

00:00:18.368 --> 00:00:18.518
Well,

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:18.738
that's,

00:00:18.738 --> 00:00:21.338
because i come from a long line of storytellers.

00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:24.778
My great grandmother told me of her childhood in montana,

00:00:25.268 --> 00:00:29.778
and my mother told us stories about growing up on the kalgoorlie cold fields.

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:33.396
My grandmother had a big black handbag,

00:00:34.028 --> 00:00:35.018
and if the maid bag,

00:00:35.028 --> 00:00:37.778
she had a large money purse with a clasp,

00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:38.598
but made a loud,

00:00:38.598 --> 00:00:41.768
satisfying click has a child.

00:00:41.988 --> 00:00:46.538
I thought grandma was very rich because the purse was full of lovely three 

00:00:46.538 --> 00:00:48.058
prisons and six pences,

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:50.238
and we were often given according to spend.

00:00:50.728 --> 00:00:53.308
Even when we were young adults and grandma's,

00:00:53.308 --> 00:00:54.438
memory was firing.

00:00:54.858 --> 00:00:55.358
My mother's.

00:00:55.358 --> 00:00:58.668
Stories were more along the lines of cautionary tales,

00:00:58.678 --> 00:00:59.438
she would say.

00:00:59.638 --> 00:01:04.238
You may be injected with a sedative and wake up to find yourself on a slow boat to china.

00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:13.181
The victim of the white slave trying to ride this was known among us girls,

00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:14.271
as in it's.

00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:14.731
A.

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:16.711
You'll never be seen again.

00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:18.291
Be aware.

00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:24.051
Camera grew up in court field at a convent education and graduated as a 

00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:29.041
trained infant teacher from direct teachers college from the age of six.

00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:30.181
Until i was twenty,

00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:31.461
i was in uniform.

00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:36.711
So it was a joy to dress up for my aunt's waiting and my debutante ball.

00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:42.361
And she headed off to teach in the bush.

00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:43.941
My first school.

00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:44.781
Was it a small,

00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:45.381
sor milling?

00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:45.971
Settle with him,

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:50.891
gippsland imported on a local firm and learn to adjust to 

00:01:50.891 --> 00:01:52.461
the challenges of country life.

00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:55.491
Campbell taught by younger sisters,

00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:57.641
and we met at a local dance.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.840
We married at clint hunt,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.170
being nineteen sixty one.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.760
After waiting,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.920
we drove to horsham in a little black box waken to begin their 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.530
married life.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.560
After ten years in rural schools in winter and the northeast,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.130
we moved back to melbourne,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.430
this time in a station wagon.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.030
Because our family had grown,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.630
weii now had a boy and three girls.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.630
As the wife of a rural school head teacher in the sixties,

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.520
life for a city girl with four young children presented plenty of challenges.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.400
A dread tiger snakes on the veranda,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.330
the mothers club.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.130
I was never bored or lonely.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.330
They were visits for many people from the district inspector,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.040
passing swaggy and once a clown in full makeup.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.100
In the seventies,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.900
camel began a long association with st mary's and danger 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.070
on the manager ofthe will spring for women they condemned along where carmen is a 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.840
volunteer.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.140
She is an incredible inspiration to the women who are here,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.990
and camel is probably the most loved person,

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:19.505
third and 

00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:21.545
final attempt in after thirty years,

00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:21.725
it's,

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:22.345
amiri's,

00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:22.765
camel,

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:25.115
retired and children had done us proud.

00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:27.215
They were settled in secure in their homes,

00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:31.815
and charism is finally time for her to develop some of her own interests.

00:03:31.825 --> 00:03:33.645
But there was yet another challenge.

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:43.169
After rob's recovered from a heart attack and bypass surgery,

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:45.619
i encouraged him to fulfill his.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.699
What office in kenya camera was diagnosed with alzheimer's disease.

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:58.339
And i seem to be moving in smaller circles.

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.460
I wasn't driving mr,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.640
or is often i'm a great reader.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.890
I haven't really been interested in any new books camel has accepted this ultimate 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.430
challenge,

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.540
and since that diagnosis in two thousand and one,

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.620
she has written a book,

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.800
which is now nearing publication.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.350
She 

00:04:22.844 --> 00:04:24.094
has written her story.

00:04:24.104 --> 00:04:26.554
I want to sort of do the camel come away,

00:04:26.564 --> 00:04:28.424
so we don't want this to end.

00:04:28.424 --> 00:04:30.905
I say what?

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:33.535
What would i do?

00:04:33.535 --> 00:04:35.755
Something i don't want to be poor,

00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:36.355
come of it,

00:04:37.155 --> 00:04:38.135
i don't want it.

00:04:37.155 --> 00:04:38.135
