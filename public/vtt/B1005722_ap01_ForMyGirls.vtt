who was an exceptional person and whose ambition and love for life enabled him to 

00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:32.311

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:07.951
father.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.211
You're no no same.

00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:15.321
This was evident throughout his life as he had a very strong work ethic and had his 

00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:18.311
career path planned very early on in his life.

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:20.851
From the age of six,

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:23.531
he started reading the newspaper the business section,

00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:24.131
of course,

00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:27.311
and continue to read it religiously every day of his life.

00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:29.911
Your daddy,

00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:30.491
steve,

00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:35.471
was a conscientious student who was academically brilliant and successfully completed 

00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:38.611
his commerce degree with honors at melbourne university.

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:41.961
At melbourne university.

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:46.411
He was one of the founding members of the financial marketing association of australia.

00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:52.341
He then went to work at instant young and corporate finance and then moved on to work at 

00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:55.011
national foods as a business development manager,

00:01:56.801 --> 00:02:01.768
your daddy moved through the corporate world at a rapid rate for someone his age and was well 

00:02:01.768 --> 00:02:03.618
respected by his peers.

00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:10.458
Despite his amazing ability to remember exact dates,

00:02:10.528 --> 00:02:11.678
times and events.

00:02:12.108 --> 00:02:15.678
Your daddy was fun to be around and loved performing tow an audience.

00:02:16.708 --> 00:02:18.528
He had confidence poison,

00:02:18.528 --> 00:02:19.568
a good sense of humor,

00:02:19.918 --> 00:02:22.418
and so public speaking was second nature to him.

00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:28.918
His ability to impersonate people was not only entertaining but legendary as 

00:02:28.918 --> 00:02:31.418
he worked the crowd with his theatrical talents.

00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:38.718
State was a very giving person and believed that the way to have good friends was 

00:02:38.718 --> 00:02:39.818
to be a good friend.

00:02:40.588 --> 00:02:41.088
And so,

00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:42.188
throughout his life,

00:02:42.298 --> 00:02:44.618
he gave to so many who were not as fortunate.

00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:50.538
He would have been proud to know that his funeral helped raise an overwhelming amount of 

00:02:50.548 --> 00:02:52.918
donations for the hat foundation.

00:02:54.338 --> 00:02:56.258
In february nineteen ninety seven,

00:02:56.708 --> 00:02:59.918
your daddy and i were married after having dated for six years.

00:03:05.858 --> 00:03:05.918
No.

00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:10.938
Two years later,

00:03:10.938 --> 00:03:13.828
we went on holiday of a lifetime toe america in europe,

00:03:13.838 --> 00:03:15.868
after much persuasion on my behalf,

00:03:16.088 --> 00:03:18.278
for him to take some time off to travel.

00:03:19.078 --> 00:03:23.928
I'm glad we did because we had a wonderful time and have beautiful memories to hold on 

00:03:23.928 --> 00:03:24.318
to.

00:03:25.888 --> 00:03:26.868
A year later,

00:03:26.968 --> 00:03:27.458
sara,

00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:32.248
you were born and your daddy simply adored you and enjoyed all the challenges of being a 

00:03:32.248 --> 00:03:32.718
father.

00:03:34.358 --> 00:03:35.358
Two years later,

00:03:35.368 --> 00:03:37.318
we're expecting a little sister for you.

00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:40.918
But two months before the arrival of baby stephanie,

00:03:41.308 --> 00:03:44.318
your daddy passed away suddenly at home of a heart attack.

00:03:45.978 --> 00:03:50.578
Two sets of ambulance and paramedics tried to revive him for forty minutes,

00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:51.818
but to no avail.

00:03:53.708 --> 00:03:55.848
When they told me they did everything they could,

00:03:56.098 --> 00:04:01.058
i kept insisting that they weren't trying hard enough because this wasn't meant to have happened to 

00:04:01.058 --> 00:04:05.587
a healthy thirty one year old who was an unfit and who never drank or smoked.

00:04:07.327 --> 00:04:08.317
Unfortunately,

00:04:08.387 --> 00:04:10.387
we never had the chance to say goodbye,

00:04:10.777 --> 00:04:15.187
and he never got the chance to see his precious second daughter being born.

00:04:15.577 --> 00:04:16.207
And that's you,

00:04:16.207 --> 00:04:20.037
stephanie and even though you,

00:04:20.037 --> 00:04:24.187
stephanie didn't get to mating now he loves you and sarah very much.

00:04:25.877 --> 00:04:29.587
It saddens me to know that he will never get to walk you girls down the aisle,

00:04:29.977 --> 00:04:34.597
make speeches at your weddings and be a grandfather because they were things we often 

00:04:34.597 --> 00:04:35.387
spoke about.

00:04:35.877 --> 00:04:40.687
And you could tell by the gleam in his eyes how much he looked forward to doing those things one day.

00:04:42.447 --> 00:04:45.067
One thing you should remember is that your daddy,

00:04:45.077 --> 00:04:48.207
who is now in heaven loves you both very much.

00:04:48.217 --> 00:04:52.887
And we'll be your special guardian angel who will watch over you for the rest of your life.

00:04:53.837 --> 00:04:57.087
And while his life was sure he's achievements were many,

00:04:57.477 --> 00:04:59.487
he touched the life of everyone he met,

00:04:59.877 --> 00:05:02.587
and he will inspire us through the rest of their lives.

00:04:59.877 --> 00:05:02.587
