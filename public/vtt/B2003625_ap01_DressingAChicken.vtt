00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.890
There are two ways to clean and dress poultry the right way.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.020
And yes,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.050
you get the wrong way.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.450
Let's not disturb this poor bird for the moment,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.850
and we'll see how to do the job the right way.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.150
First of all,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.840
we need a knife,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.950
shears secure and strength.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.850
If you are right handed,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.050
place the bird on its side with the breast facing you and feet to the right.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.400
Take the knife and make an incision at the bank of the neck and continue the cut down the 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.150
length of the neck to the shoulder blades.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.140
Turn the bird over and complete the incision,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.550
the full circle of the neck.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.950
Now pull the skin back over the bridge,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.380
which were a veal,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.350
a crop firmly attached to the skin.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.600
Loosen the crop thoroughly and disconnect it and the wind pipe deep down in the neck 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.650
cavity with the night.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.850
Cut the neck off about one inch from the base,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.450
thus disposing of crop wind by the head.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.900
In order to loosen the connective tissue,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.540
a car is made on either side of the neck to the scalito structure.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.300
The bird is then firmly held in the left hand and the second finger of the right hand is 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.240
used to loosen any remaining connective tissue holding the entrails in place.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.540
This operation must be carried out thoroughly to ensure keen removal of entrails.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.340
Having completed this day,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.540
we now invert the bird and make the pill big incision.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.840
This is where the most errors are made in poetry dressing.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.140
Frequently a vertical cut is made from the breastbone to the vent.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.640
This is wrong.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.040
The correct method is to place the finger over the event and the knife on the tail.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.040
The cut is then made between the vent and detail that is under the vent and over the tape.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.840
This is most important.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.860
Having reached this stage,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.340
it is necessary to disconnect the power from the vent and draw it away from the caca.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.340
This will prevent contamination of the cock.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.380
We now complete the loosening of connective tissues by forcing the finger into the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.490
abdominal cavity.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.540
Make sure that you disconnect the fatty tissue on the wall of the abdomen.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.390
The entrails are forced out by placing the sun behind the gizzard.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.810
It will be found that the entrails will come away cleanly.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.420
Having cleaned the bird.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.560
The next job is to trust and tired down once again.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.580
If you are right handed,

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.270
placed the bird on its side,

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.440
breast ward you and legs to the left.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.440
The security is first incited into the wind.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.840
Now it is important that it be placed in the correct position.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.970
If we can examine the wing,

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.840
we find it resembles the human arm.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.230
We have the shoulder,

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.970
elbow,

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.040
thumb and the hand.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.680
Along the outer edge of the wing.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.740
Between the shoulder and the elbow is a singer,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.340
which we used to hold the secure in position.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.270
The cure is placed under this venue,

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.620
but over the bone between the shoulder and the elbow.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.310
The leg is then forced up high enough to allow the skewer to pass through the skin of a leg,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.920
not the muscle and over the back of the bird to prevent the secure 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.440
breaking,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.140
grasp it firmly in the hand,

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.980
rigid with sun,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.340
and forced the outside or upside leg onto the school.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.940
Now all that remains to be done is to pin the wing too obscure.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.460
To improve its appearance.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.340
The bird is spread on the skewer before the tying operation,

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.540
which comes next.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.040
Placed the burden on the string parallel with the heart.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.440
Bring both ends up between the legs and the body,

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.090
invert the bird and tie securely.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.140
It is most important to bring the string up between the leg and the body.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.040
To further improve the appearance,

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.840
the pelvic bone is spread to add to the plumpness of the carcass.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.850
To enhance the appearance of the rear end,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.940
the vent is fastened to the tail.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.640
Final touch is added by dropping the breast.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.040
Insert the shares on either side of the breast,

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.240
making the cut approximately one third of the way along the breast bone.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.440
The neck incision is covered with the skin,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.640
which is held in position by the window.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.140
The result.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.870
Ah,

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.430
highly attractive and appetizing cocker so different toe.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.430
