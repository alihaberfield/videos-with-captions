00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:47.646
I like our recall.

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:51.846
Passing out last night as a nurse was taking my temperature.

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:54.306
Everything is fuzzy.

00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:58.506
I cannot fight us on the exits on about the door.

00:00:58.996 --> 00:01:00.676
Am i going blind?

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:03.736
I cannot move my right arm or leg.

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.756
I cannot lift my head.

00:01:06.436 --> 00:01:09.806
They're now saying i cannot talk 

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:12.726
after awake.

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:16.646
Every heavy exercises i say better.

00:01:16.646 --> 00:01:18.106
I can talk a little.

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:20.206
I talked layard lee,

00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:23.436
a young girl on work experience,

00:01:23.436 --> 00:01:24.506
comes to visit.

00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:26.506
I can't hear you.

00:01:26.896 --> 00:01:29.706
She draws back her hair and chase me.

00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:33.106
You're here hearing aids and she writes me a night.

00:01:33.596 --> 00:01:36.906
My first positive communication.

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:38.596
I was different.

00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:40.136
I didn't realize it.

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:43.886
But after rehabilitation are realized,

00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:46.376
my life has changed or not.

00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:51.306
The person my wife had married or the person my friends knew.

00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:53.406
I think i almost signed.

00:01:53.796 --> 00:01:58.106
But their responses and reactions to me were different.

00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:01.020
The new one says off.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.710
Say on that we're gone.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.040
Music,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.190
question noise,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.490
jugs confused may any place,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.480
personal relationships,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.120
same to go out the window.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.080
I just did not seem to exist anymore.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.610
I tried to continue with golf and fishing that if someone said 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.210
something,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.780
yell of the blade war had they back to make,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.280
i just wouldn't know what it meant.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.710
Eventually,

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.680
people begin to tire of the if it took to communicate with may 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.220
that i had to.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.630
My girl answers and accept that as a general course of 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.750
things at family gatherings,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.980
i soon fielded simply just to observe.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.820
It was too noisy for me.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.510
If i wanted something clarified,

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.850
i would get someone aside with an ill day and get youth.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.700
Our wanted oh,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.990
friends have nay,

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.600
our been replaced by new friends who are in the 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.680
same boat as may searching for identity,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.890
not hearing people or death people.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.830
Just in between the advent of digital 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.530
hearing aid,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.220
torreon nineteen ninety five has given me more depth and every 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.680
ation of cnn's.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.890
I can once again hear the say ryan on the rave 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.680
chirping of birds.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.150
I would love to him.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.780
Our grandchildren talk.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.950
It is disappointing not to wayne,

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.280
so when nice bake.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.150
But i'm very grateful to the people of help.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.380
Like the technology for assisted listening devices,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.910
telephones and caption tv.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.180
I accept my lot,

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.660
my pleasure,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.672
naylor saying.

00:04:01.672 --> 00:04:03.162
Why family together,

00:04:03.162 --> 00:04:07.462
enjoying themselves on prey out of their achievements.

00:04:08.052 --> 00:04:12.562
I nail have five grandchildren and great grandchildren 

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:17.612
like an old wait in the garden or i am thankful to 

00:04:17.612 --> 00:04:18.502

00:04:17.612 --> 00:04:18.502
