00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:33.802
David a work very early on his last day at the island from the 

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:34.672
holiday cottage,

00:00:34.672 --> 00:00:37.292
he could see the fishing boats leaving for their day's work.

00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:51.392
David had some early morning visitors.

00:00:52.512 --> 00:00:54.692
They were horses which lived on the island,

00:00:55.582 --> 00:00:58.292
wild horses free to roam wherever they like,

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:02.992
from the steep galleys down the bush tracks to the sandy beaches.

00:01:04.342 --> 00:01:06.992
A family of horses had come in search of breakfast,

00:01:07.782 --> 00:01:09.642
and david didn't disappoint them.

00:01:10.482 --> 00:01:12.392
He found a few carrots in the kitchen.

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:27.772
David,

00:01:27.952 --> 00:01:29.942
having lived near the city all his life,

00:01:30.262 --> 00:01:31.612
wasn't very experienced.

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:32.592
It feeding horses.

00:01:33.582 --> 00:01:36.282
He wasn't quite sure that he could trust the horses,

00:01:36.582 --> 00:01:39.362
not to nibble his fingers along with the carrot.

00:01:57.732 --> 00:01:58.792
Before you used it.

00:01:58.782 --> 00:01:59.322
Long,

00:01:59.332 --> 00:02:03.930
flexible lips like fingers and a thumb gently take the character from 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.340
david.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.480
The horses would've stayed to eat carrots all morning,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.150
but david and promise to meet kip at the beach very early and he didn't want to keep the elf 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.580
waiting.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.180
There was no sign of tip of the beach,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.300
and as david waited,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.280
he blew up his new beach ball.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.880
Kip had really seen the beach long before david,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.280
and he thought of a trick while he was waiting.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.630
He hid behind a rock and watched until david had blown the ball as far as it would 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.540
go pending.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.410
It's about time you turned up.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.880
I've been waiting for hours behind that rock.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.880
David told him about stopping to feed the wild horses,

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.120
but now i think i'll have a swim in the sea.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.980
You're coming into.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.275
Kip said he didn't think he liked water very much being a pushover.

00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:05.575
You thought it wait on the rock until david came out.

00:04:16.305 --> 00:04:21.265
David was careful not to venture away from the shallows and when kipps or 

00:04:21.265 --> 00:04:25.785
what a wonderful time he was having couldn't resist paddling at the water's edge 

00:04:25.785 --> 00:04:26.275
himself,

00:04:27.165 --> 00:04:28.975
although he did keep his shoes on.

00:05:22.165 --> 00:05:25.415
David had plans to build a magnificent sandcastle,

00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:29.085
and kip thought that he had tried his hand at castle making,

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:29.375
too.

00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:40.725
The elf didn't often venture away from the grove of banks years and pen dennis palms,

00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:41.775
where he had made his home,

00:05:42.865 --> 00:05:46.775
but he found himself quite enjoying these days at the beach with david.

00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:55.915
David wanted to make his castle big enough,

00:05:55.925 --> 00:05:57.075
but kept climbing.

00:05:58.365 --> 00:06:03.225
He broke the sand up around his hand and then took it out to live a hollow inside.

00:06:18.072 --> 00:06:18.592
The beach.

00:06:18.602 --> 00:06:21.042
Spade was just the right size the kid.

00:06:30.772 --> 00:06:35.392
David duggan note round his castle and kept patting the loose sand 

00:06:35.402 --> 00:06:36.382
firm on hiss.

00:06:40.372 --> 00:06:41.382
Put a shell on top.

00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:46.202
And hollowed out a doorway at the front.

00:06:57.732 --> 00:06:58.122
David.

00:06:58.122 --> 00:06:58.692
It's morning.

00:07:00.172 --> 00:07:04.932
He strengthen his castle with fortresses and made it stick so that kid 

00:07:05.072 --> 00:07:06.082
could climb into it.

00:07:13.002 --> 00:07:16.282
They needed some little trees to plant around david's castle,

00:07:16.872 --> 00:07:19.982
and these pieces of casuarina were just the thing.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.742
Green seaweed in the moat was a good idea.

00:07:30.572 --> 00:07:33.482
It made the castle stand out from the rest of the sand.

00:07:38.442 --> 00:07:43.302
Kept decorated the walls with a pattern of tones from casuarina trees and 

00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:45.382
david filled in the spaces with shell.

00:07:51.072 --> 00:07:53.282
Now it was finished and ready for kids.

00:07:54.472 --> 00:07:58.082
He gingerly climbed up the sand steps and into the castle.

00:07:59.872 --> 00:08:04.823
David laughed and called him his regal majesty kip king of the 

00:08:04.823 --> 00:08:05.363
castle.

00:08:06.853 --> 00:08:11.513
Kip said he wouldn't feel very regal if it started to rain as the castle had no roof.

00:08:13.303 --> 00:08:14.993
After all this castle building,

00:08:15.173 --> 00:08:17.073
the two felt like some exercise.

00:08:17.503 --> 00:08:19.123
So they run around the beach,

00:08:19.153 --> 00:08:19.913
the sand you 

00:08:26.203 --> 00:08:26.803
the dunes,

00:08:26.803 --> 00:08:31.553
received the force of the ocean winds and act as a windbreak for the bush 

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:32.813
land growing behind them.

00:08:33.803 --> 00:08:34.753
They made huge,

00:08:34.753 --> 00:08:35.243
natural,

00:08:35.243 --> 00:08:35.833
slippery dip,

00:08:36.503 --> 00:08:39.613
and keeping david spent the rest of the day sliding on them.

00:09:05.803 --> 00:09:07.513
Climbing up again wasn't so easy.

00:09:10.303 --> 00:09:13.433
David noticed that grasses and creepers grew in the set.

00:09:14.573 --> 00:09:17.303
They hold the sand together in windy with.

00:09:37.303 --> 00:09:41.013
The two friends parted at kips pen dennis treehouse.

00:09:42.603 --> 00:09:46.983
David explained that his holiday was over and that he had to return home.

00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:48.663
It made,

00:09:48.673 --> 00:09:49.523
kip said,

00:09:49.533 --> 00:09:51.113
to think of parting with his friend.

00:09:51.803 --> 00:09:56.213
But he cheered up a little when david promised to visit the island whenever he could.

00:10:01.933 --> 00:10:06.432
David had walked only a little way up the track when he suddenly had an idea,

00:10:07.262 --> 00:10:08.532
a very good idea.

00:10:09.522 --> 00:10:10.932
He ran back to tell kip,

00:10:12.592 --> 00:10:13.962
why don't you come home with me?

00:10:13.962 --> 00:10:14.432
He asked.

00:10:15.422 --> 00:10:17.132
You can have a holiday at my house.

00:10:18.822 --> 00:10:23.742
Kip thought about this carefully and then that's a wonderful 

00:10:23.742 --> 00:10:24.182
idea.

00:10:24.182 --> 00:10:24.632
He said,

00:10:25.282 --> 00:10:25.772
come on,

00:10:25.772 --> 00:10:26.332
let's go.

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:33.032
David didn't want kids to be seen on the way home from the island,

00:10:33.572 --> 00:10:35.832
so he planned to hide him in his day.

00:10:46.772 --> 00:10:48.132
It was a tight squeeze,

00:10:48.582 --> 00:10:50.032
but he managed to shut the lid.

00:10:55.272 --> 00:10:59.632
David struggled to put the heavy bag on as he hunted to catch the boat.

00:11:05.122 --> 00:11:05.502
Goodbye,

00:11:05.502 --> 00:11:05.722
kitt.

00:11:05.732 --> 00:11:06.112
Goodbye,

00:11:06.112 --> 00:11:06.342
kitt.

00:11:06.352 --> 00:11:06.752
Goodbye.

00:11:06.752 --> 00:11:08.782
Kitt called a bird from the bank.

00:11:08.782 --> 00:11:09.392
See a tree?

00:11:13.922 --> 00:11:16.082
Kept wave to all his island friend.

00:11:17.422 --> 00:11:19.522
He could hardly keep still in the bag.

00:11:19.922 --> 00:11:23.532
He felt so excited at the thought of indenture zaheer.

00:11:19.922 --> 00:11:23.532
