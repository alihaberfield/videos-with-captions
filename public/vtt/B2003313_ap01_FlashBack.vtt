00:00:00.557 --> 00:00:02.347
Today with monotonous regularity.

00:00:02.347 --> 00:00:04.467
Australian newspapers carry headlines.

00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:07.167
They reflect the shocking trend in the conduct of our youth.

00:00:07.777 --> 00:00:11.217
So which parental elements and lack of supervision is about to play.

00:00:12.217 --> 00:00:14.777
It would be easy to blame the places where young people gather,

00:00:15.457 --> 00:00:16.577
but that would be abating.

00:00:16.587 --> 00:00:17.357
The real issue.

00:00:49.997 --> 00:00:50.567
The old adage,

00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:52.217
but they find mr,

00:00:52.237 --> 00:00:54.907
yet for idle hands to do applies,

00:00:54.917 --> 00:00:59.907
particularly many young off alien parents do not bother to check how or with whom 

00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:01.037
they're spending their time.

00:01:04.537 --> 00:01:08.047
Adolescents are struggling with their feelings of aggression and sexuality,

00:01:08.407 --> 00:01:10.747
along with the need to establish an identity.

00:01:11.477 --> 00:01:13.977
They're rebelling and experimenting sexually,

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:16.387
trying to find out who they want to be,

00:01:16.387 --> 00:01:17.887
like what they want to become.

00:01:17.887 --> 00:01:18.637
A they go over.

00:01:37.507 --> 00:01:37.837
Here.

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:39.317
Freedom,

00:01:39.727 --> 00:01:40.177
freedom!

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.457
That's enough to frighten any parent.

00:01:42.937 --> 00:01:44.877
The imagination is running wild.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.670
To be in the movie a while.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.720
You're in one now.

00:02:06.998 --> 00:02:07.338
No,

00:02:07.338 --> 00:02:07.818
i'm not.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.648
Kids today have no manners,

00:02:23.658 --> 00:02:24.818
no sense of values.

00:02:25.348 --> 00:02:27.358
Half of them are longhairs drug addicts.

00:02:27.738 --> 00:02:30.468
You just have to listen to the news or read the papers to see it.

00:02:35.108 --> 00:02:39.828
A time of rapid change for this anxiety and escape from anxiety,

00:02:40.408 --> 00:02:42.598
and fans have been put on the defensive by neighbours,

00:02:42.848 --> 00:02:44.188
the police teacher,

00:02:45.128 --> 00:02:48.748
all of only quite long hair or being different with drugs.

00:02:51.718 --> 00:02:52.958
It's a psychedelic trip.

00:02:53.098 --> 00:02:56.648
Really worth risking damage to your minds and your bodies.

00:02:57.498 --> 00:02:58.288
How do you know,

00:02:58.298 --> 00:02:58.588
mom?

00:02:58.598 --> 00:02:59.998
You've never experienced it,

00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:00.398
you know.

00:03:01.438 --> 00:03:01.578
Well,

00:03:01.578 --> 00:03:02.638
i don't have syphilis,

00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:02.988
so no,

00:03:02.988 --> 00:03:03.528
i don't want it.

00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:13.718
Behind every head of long hair does not like a mind distorted by drugs.

00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:19.548
Some of the most thoughtful studios alert an eager mind belong to our sons and daughters.

00:03:33.348 --> 00:03:33.878
Most kids,

00:03:33.878 --> 00:03:34.918
they're essentially moral.

00:03:35.788 --> 00:03:38.728
They think a great deal about who they are and where they're going.

00:03:57.888 --> 00:03:58.918
It's so important.

00:03:59.358 --> 00:04:04.198
Let the young for new ideas for ideas and even rebellions be 

00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:04.498
good.

00:04:14.813 --> 00:04:15.363
If we live,

00:04:16.983 --> 00:04:21.163
if we really if we must do right now and it's important to them 

00:04:21.173 --> 00:04:24.373
way given the same respect would give a passing stranger,

00:04:25.153 --> 00:04:26.503
i might be able to get a move on.

00:04:25.153 --> 00:04:26.503
