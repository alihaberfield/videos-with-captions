00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:52.105
I want to tell the story about my grandmother,

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:53.405
my paul,

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:54.585
my bottom line,

00:00:55.035 --> 00:00:55.955
my mother's mother.

00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:00.705
Every year we make offerings to remember her passing away.

00:01:02.905 --> 00:01:05.245
There are no photos of me as a child in vietnam.

00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:08.845
When i asked mom what was she like?

00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:12.245
She tells me stories of maya paul.

00:01:15.235 --> 00:01:16.225
I was like walker,

00:01:16.225 --> 00:01:16.735
they say,

00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:18.565
because she was always carrying me on her heat.

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:22.205
My cousin's one sport herb.

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:24.445
If they came with real rich crane,

00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:26.385
it looks so amazing.

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:27.445
Student once cut it.

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:31.225
The last time she held me,

00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:31.845
i was too.

00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:34.245
Just before my family left vietnam.

00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:36.545
We left on a boat.

00:01:37.035 --> 00:01:39.715
Dead was the ship's mechanic mom dead,

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:44.635
and three young children under four made it to hong kong before arriving in australia in 

00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:45.695
nineteen eighty one.

00:01:47.835 --> 00:01:52.445
Mum burns paper painted in gold and silver leaf to send away for our ancestors.

00:01:54.075 --> 00:01:55.395
My grandmother passed away.

00:01:55.785 --> 00:01:56.035
Mom,

00:01:56.035 --> 00:01:57.115
not outside our flat,

00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:58.195
making us more fine.

00:01:58.195 --> 00:01:58.905
A tin can.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.670
I cried because i was very sad for my mother.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.600
During that week,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.930
a large dark butterfly appeared in our flat,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.630
resting on the ceiling.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.030
When she was alive,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.630
grandmother taught her kids she would return as a butterfly.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.010
Mom tells us the butterflies,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.930
our par visiting us in her transition to the next life.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.630
Was this her way to finally see us again?

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.060
I watched my grandparent's girl from the photos we receive from vietnam,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.580
and i kept schooled my cousins.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.150
Sometimes i would imagine where i'd be standing if i was there,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.530
too.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.530
Now that i have my own child,

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.030
i can really see how lucky she used to have all her grandparents and great grandparents to play with.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.030
