WEBVTT

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.640
It's called the public.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.590
It's written on one of the wheelbarrows over this.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.770
Ever since we started,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.470
we called it the fitzroy adventure playground,

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.310
and the kid you saw when you're coming down to the woods chose to put the witch because of all the wood here and then just gradually 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.450
turned out it was the cubbies.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.780
And because they're always building.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.660
Coming was just known everywhere as the cubbies.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.010
In fact,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.600
some of the parents wouldn't even notice if it toe adventure program.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.150
Right.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.210
She writhe,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.160
baby joe.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.390
And what 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.320
shit?

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.400
Right down,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.620
baby.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.430
Everybody's talking 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.050
way.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.240
No way.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.440
Shit.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.320
Right down,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.640
dad.

00:01:29.360 --> aN:aN:000NaN


00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.150
Wait.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.690
No.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.470
He says.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.230
As soon as we get wood and we can't even get around to staking it or boxes come in the kitchen in there,

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.138
they're building their takeover immediately.

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:06.668
Let me.

00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:41.078
Wait.

00:02:44.158 --> 00:02:44.468
Chris.

00:02:59.458 --> 00:02:59.538
Yeah,

00:03:00.338 --> 00:03:01.508
and i'm delighted to be here.

00:03:01.508 --> 00:03:03.728
This morning at one of my favorite places,

00:03:03.738 --> 00:03:05.518
the fitzroy adventure playground.

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:10.488
I wass for twelve years in charge of a home and children section off the 

00:03:10.488 --> 00:03:11.828
national safety council.

00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:14.158
And during this time break,

00:03:14.168 --> 00:03:18.388
many parents rang me out because they were worried about accidents in playgrounds.

00:03:18.558 --> 00:03:23.108
That is three ordinary playgrounds that we see around that there's an adventure.

00:03:23.118 --> 00:03:25.768
Playground is quite a different sort of thing.

00:03:26.158 --> 00:03:31.108
An adventure playground is a place that is supervised as 

00:03:31.118 --> 00:03:35.428
well as the heart of the playground that they're so helpful to children and teaching them 

00:03:35.438 --> 00:03:37.928
creativity and responsibility.

00:03:38.138 --> 00:03:41.468
We feel also that they are extraordinarily safe.

00:03:46.218 --> 00:03:46.438
Yeah.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.800
Most kids learn they've no,

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.090
i know you always wear your shoes.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.320
You don't walk on piles of wood.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.690
The children who do tend to stand on the nail other want to come in here?

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.550
You haven't been here for a long time or they're coming.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.910
It's the first time in here and also wonder around and not really be very alert.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.390
Um,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.730
we always check that they have tetanus needles,

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.700
and we always take him up to check it home.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.440
And we always sort of cover any sort of an accident in any hood away.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.210
It all like that.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.420
Thank you.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.100
I can't stand to the right.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.480
And part of that means one of the fathers fighting for what?

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.020
Again,

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.470
jackie.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.250
A little bit of everything.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.910
Just whatever's later doing cleanup from things like that.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.630
What do you think about the fight?

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.810
I mean,

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.680
you should wear anything you got about seven,

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:52.870
about seven.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.210
Just a place where kids can come and enjoy themselves and do what they want to do with that thing,

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.960
right?

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.000
You don't think about it.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.780
What do you think?

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.400
That sort of things?

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.440
We get criticisms about the dirt,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.310
you know that this is what we want.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.490
There's plenty of price like gonna be calling,

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.450
but i always come here sort of person who works in a playground.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.450
There's no set training.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.040
I suppose you could say it's what you're looking for is someone who could be a mom and a dad and a policeman and a 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.910
friend and resources all those sort of things rolled into together,

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.010
someone who's willing to learn along with the children and not know too much because you can know too much and the kids kind of 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.840
teach you anything.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.060
You put that back 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.990
yeah.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.840
Looking.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:43.940
Kids do what they want,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.040
teo,

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.170
you put it into practice.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.120
You get me a runner and getting 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.340
no,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.160
stick it on a plate.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.990
Getting out.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.080
Important thing is to become friends with you.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.950
Really.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.830
But i'm gonna no,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.950
but time to go.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.970
What?

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.800
Happened that one good.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.940
That's on the kids not want.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.370
Smell it now.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.460
Thank you.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.530
That's when all the pockets you can have one.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.710
I support activities such as this fitzroy adventure playground by performer.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.930
Wonderful role,

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.410
no kids.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.270
Khun exercise initiative.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.560
You know,

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.460
some people think of the adventure playground as the green pine logs for kids to climb on.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.490
That's not adventure.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.430
Playground a tall,

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.950
the real concept of an adventure playground is,

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.160
we're children do things for themselves.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.030
They designed their own structures and buildings.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.180
I can have the little rabbit,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.830
maybe a little crop of vegetables playoffs.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.010
People go around.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.260
So just such a miss,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.510
well,

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.370
you know,

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:32.710
i may be,

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:33.100
it does.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.070
It's like a junkyard,

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:35.270
but i don't find it an attractive.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.260
I found it rather fascinating.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.150
It's like a date got,

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.200
uh,

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:39.830
keep the painting.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:40.730
There are unnatural things.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.450
They're building things.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.550
It's like a little higgledy piggledy,

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.130
shanty town and,

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:44.850
uh,

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.030
sort of thing that is attractive to children.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.020
And i also find it attractive.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.390
And i think you know quite a few adults,

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.670
too.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.760
So they can buy and some people from other fires going and they see it.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.710
They just looks exciting.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.290
And to the indian states,

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.780
artistic in its own sort of met away children,

00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:59.130
dad,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.410
the children come in and out in and out and some of them in here for five years coming in and out.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.532
And it's it's not like just a little group that you're picking up,

00:08:06.542 --> 00:08:10.392
taking up somewhere like a family one.

00:08:10.392 --> 00:08:12.162
If you've got kids going to that vent,

00:08:12.652 --> 00:08:16.782

00:08:18.362 --> 00:08:19.162

00:08:22.852 --> 00:08:24.022
He is in that mud.

00:08:28.552 --> 00:08:32.762
The tithe.

00:08:35.362 --> 00:08:35.882

I want swat running free,

00:08:46.952 --> 00:08:47.362

First job,

00:10:00.832 --> 00:10:02.212
What front?

00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:05.022
That's really lovely.

00:10:05.676 --> 00:10:06.366
Let me do that.

00:10:08.396 --> 00:10:08.706

00:10:09.296 --> 00:10:09.366
Oh,

You should come.

00:10:21.696 --> 00:10:21.756
No.

00:10:33.196 --> 00:10:33.406
But 

00:10:46.956 --> 00:10:51.076
and now you have chocolate coming in old scrap with net.

00:10:51.316 --> 00:10:53.806
And that's all about to build this cage of two friends.

00:10:54.826 --> 00:10:57.596
And it was hard job.

00:10:57.976 --> 00:10:58.316
Well,

00:10:58.326 --> 00:10:58.626

00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:19.136

00:11:19.186 --> 00:11:21.796
People learned about pigeons not to care about him.

00:11:21.796 --> 00:11:23.336
That's the people you help.

00:11:24.436 --> 00:11:24.626
Well,

00:11:24.826 --> 00:11:25.416

00:11:42.396 --> 00:11:43.036
They are with me.

00:11:44.396 --> 00:11:45.586
I need another bit of wood to go on.

00:11:49.646 --> 00:11:51.006
Otherwise they're just pull through,

00:11:51.006 --> 00:11:51.306
i think,

00:11:52.996 --> 00:11:57.586

00:11:57.596 --> 00:11:59.206

00:11:59.446 --> 00:12:02.126
He took eyebrow shed when he was building it knocked everybody out.

00:12:02.316 --> 00:12:03.676
And who was working at the time?

00:12:03.676 --> 00:12:04.456
You get about boats,

00:12:04.466 --> 00:12:07.216
way happen to just get this very light warning that you need for both.

00:12:07.843 --> 00:12:08.383
And,

00:12:08.393 --> 00:12:08.763
uh,

00:12:08.963 --> 00:12:09.273
you know,

00:12:09.283 --> 00:12:10.813
that's what james is really going on.

00:12:18.963 --> 00:12:19.823
And when it did start up,

00:12:19.833 --> 00:12:22.053
there were certain elements of negative nous in it.

00:12:22.263 --> 00:12:25.413
It was inclined to be bring in rubbish and burn it,

00:12:25.413 --> 00:12:28.973
and somebody put up a bit of caviar and everybody else would knock it down.

00:12:30.713 --> 00:12:34.013
Maybe not much control their stories coming from.

00:12:34.903 --> 00:12:39.713
They're staying home from school and hiding in these things all day and many doing about it.

00:12:41.103 --> 00:12:41.733
But anyway,

00:12:41.733 --> 00:12:42.613
as time went on,

00:12:43.003 --> 00:12:47.683
the area was reduced here so that there was a small overlook,

00:12:47.693 --> 00:12:48.083
the back,

00:12:48.093 --> 00:12:52.063
which is of some value to the children down to get a kicking like the sport.

00:12:52.403 --> 00:12:57.393
And the thing i liked about this was the think they introduced things like keeping 

00:12:57.403 --> 00:12:57.863
pits.

00:12:57.873 --> 00:13:02.303
I could take any pigs and i had fails rabbits and all sorts of things,

00:13:02.303 --> 00:13:04.683
and they were coming in and caring for those things,

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:06.483
and i felt that's a humanizing thing.

00:13:06.483 --> 00:13:07.673
In children's environment,

00:13:07.903 --> 00:13:12.753
that child care spect covers very broad field in the sense that giving 

00:13:12.753 --> 00:13:16.563
children the chance to for animal delaying the responsibility of having animals 

00:13:19.603 --> 00:13:20.203
i don't have it.

00:13:23.473 --> 00:13:26.103
We're taking just without getting into the real estate.

00:13:27.383 --> 00:13:28.233
Two dollars h,

00:13:28.243 --> 00:13:29.123
that was fair enough.

00:13:30.593 --> 00:13:31.873
And also we're stopping the building.

00:13:33.003 --> 00:13:33.823
So what we did,

00:13:33.833 --> 00:13:34.643
we decided that kids,

00:13:34.643 --> 00:13:35.473
when they're finished a cage,

00:13:35.483 --> 00:13:36.393
they should either record.

00:13:36.563 --> 00:13:39.313
If it was left and it was strong and something to put over within a week,

00:13:40.003 --> 00:13:40.713
they're allowed to have it.

00:13:45.603 --> 00:13:46.403
Any pictures you got,

00:13:46.413 --> 00:13:46.813
claudia.

00:13:49.903 --> 00:13:53.753
Can you have the courage for your own good?

00:13:53.763 --> 00:13:55.193
You might separate thing was that man,

00:13:55.453 --> 00:13:56.183
you're gonna step right.

00:13:56.183 --> 00:13:57.293
The values we haven't done that.

00:13:57.593 --> 00:13:59.883
Not one of the eyes chilean.

00:13:59.883 --> 00:14:00.143
Don'tyou.

00:14:00.143 --> 00:14:00.713
Where you from?

00:14:01.823 --> 00:14:04.223
You haven't given australia that to you?

00:14:05.023 --> 00:14:07.243
When he was just found them to be infringed,

00:14:07.243 --> 00:14:08.983
they were very much on it in the outskirts.

00:14:09.105 --> 00:14:10.765
Jump alive the roofs and drive us nuts.

00:14:11.635 --> 00:14:11.715
Yeah.

00:14:17.035 --> 00:14:17.245
On it.

00:14:27.135 --> 00:14:31.735
They're breaking through this life well twisted.

00:14:33.335 --> 00:14:34.945
I was caught in a fishing line string.

00:14:38.905 --> 00:14:42.545
I have to cut the soft living in there for a while so i can get better.

00:14:44.755 --> 00:14:45.285
Shot.

00:14:46.335 --> 00:14:46.425
What?

00:14:46.495 --> 00:14:47.365
Did you do it?

00:14:49.995 --> 00:14:51.445
You gotta get so don't cut the pigeon.

00:14:52.535 --> 00:14:53.485
You can't just get it.

00:14:53.555 --> 00:14:54.145
Get it right.

00:14:54.635 --> 00:14:56.045
Get it right when it's late night.

00:14:57.085 --> 00:14:57.535
Get up now.

00:15:03.435 --> 00:15:06.445
With something good.

00:15:07.335 --> 00:15:07.975
He broke in,

00:15:08.695 --> 00:15:11.245
distressing for kids to find things a lot,

00:15:11.255 --> 00:15:12.135
but that's a living thing.

00:15:12.135 --> 00:15:13.135
That's what happens in life.

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:13.835
Someone give up.

00:15:14.085 --> 00:15:14.605
I don't want to do.

00:15:14.605 --> 00:15:15.585
You don't have him anymore.

00:15:15.785 --> 00:15:17.995
I just sort of come back and i'm going to keep them.

00:15:17.995 --> 00:15:19.605
And the other day we had a break in.

00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:20.865
One of the bigger kids came and said,

00:15:21.165 --> 00:15:21.345

00:15:21.345 --> 00:15:23.365

00:15:23.735 --> 00:15:24.145
you know,

00:15:24.155 --> 00:15:27.065
talk to the kid about it and it is a thing that happens in life.

00:15:27.455 --> 00:15:30.645
Checks is look alive was when he died.

00:15:31.135 --> 00:15:35.605

00:15:35.615 --> 00:15:36.395

00:15:39.535 --> 00:15:40.375

Everybody's talking about a new 

00:16:34.348 --> 00:16:38.098
way 

00:16:42.088 --> 00:16:42.958

Order sort of comes from like,

00:17:19.198 --> 00:17:20.488
an angina sort of order.

00:17:25.178 --> 00:17:27.988
You did be themselves and play on their own tune.

00:17:37.578 --> 00:17:38.838
And it's a learning prices.

00:17:38.838 --> 00:17:40.818
They're learning about things for a living.

00:17:38.838 --> 00:17:40.818
