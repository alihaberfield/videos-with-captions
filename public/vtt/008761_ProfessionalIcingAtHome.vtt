00:00:20.184 --> 00:00:20.244
No.

00:00:32.984 --> 00:00:37.494
It's always a party time in somebody's home and for the your authority.

00:00:39.084 --> 00:00:39.994
It makes the poppy.

00:00:40.884 --> 00:00:44.294
You could give your cakes that professional air when you i summer home.

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:45.474
I think,

00:00:45.474 --> 00:00:45.634
khun,

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:47.064
be a fascinating hobby,

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:51.894
and there's no limit to the variety of designs you can create once you've had a little press,

00:00:52.944 --> 00:00:55.394
even beautiful birthday cakes like this one.

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:03.544
Now he's a simple funded icing that could be rolled on the board just as you would a 

00:01:03.554 --> 00:01:04.094
pastry.

00:01:04.614 --> 00:01:06.094
It's a mixture of glucose,

00:01:06.684 --> 00:01:06.994
egg,

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:08.594
right and arson sugar.

00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:13.394
You mix it in the basement color flavor as you desire,

00:01:13.884 --> 00:01:14.294
then,

00:01:14.684 --> 00:01:15.794
with a rolling pin,

00:01:16.184 --> 00:01:20.494
roll it out to the size and shape that you required to cover your case.

00:01:21.334 --> 00:01:22.594
It's quite easily done.

00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:24.594
It's soft and pliable,

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:26.694
and yet it's very easily handled.

00:01:30.484 --> 00:01:35.474
Wrote smoothly and even leaves press it 

00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:36.994
lightly into shape.

00:01:37.684 --> 00:01:39.494
Leave it with the palm of your hand.

00:01:44.184 --> 00:01:45.194
All there is to it.

00:01:48.084 --> 00:01:52.394
No to cover the case to enable this fund and icing 

00:01:52.784 --> 00:01:54.894
to cling to the cake after it's cut,

00:01:55.984 --> 00:02:00.854
brush it with egg or rethink this gas tonight because 

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:05.690
james will do bash it carefully around the sides from the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.080
top show that it's completely covered.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.110
Now to put the icing on the cake.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.410
Well,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.580
you would pastry around your rolling pin.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.690
Lift up in,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.580
carefully transferred onto the case and a nro.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.480
It's just too easy of that.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.280
Move with the palms of the hands,

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.280
which is invested with icing sugar and pushed the icing 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.680
show that completely covered the case.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.160
See how you feel.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.370
We've prepared that board covered with blue tinsel paper just to make it attractive.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.260
Now lift this cake back onto the prepared board and 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.990
again,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.480
a few finishing touches.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.760
Just smooth dog.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.280
The arson sugar makes it glossy and appearance.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.630
The hands smooth out the wrinkles,

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.220
and then you have a cake with a professional finished,

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.480
too.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.430
A different kind of icing is used for decorating and furbish.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.280
We recommend royal icing.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.780
It's a mixture off beaten egg,

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.680
white and pure icing sugar.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.680
Pure sugar into the basin and big vigorously 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.280
until the mixture will hold its shape.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.480
Only pure ice in cuba should be used for this kind of icing.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.980
I think mixture has a percentage of corn flour in it,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.480
and for that it is quite unsuitable for moralizing.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.580
Tented carefully with vegetable coloring.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.380
You lied all shades for cake making,

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.820
so add the color sparingly again.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.770
They vigorously to make sure the color is evenly blended 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.740
in the icing.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.080
Catholic.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.160
I think with a damp cloth to stop a crushed forming on a fast is not in 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.420
use.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.320
And now for our equipment.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.310
These are seen tubes and necessary for decorating.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.520
The first is a writing to a plain one for letters or writing.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.910
The second is a stopped you for borders,

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.620
ages or scrolls.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.320
A larger star pipe might be useful for heavier decoration.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.820
A leaf pipe has a serrated blade and a rose.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.120
A people pipe is used for making roses,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.820
daisies or other flowers.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.340
Each tube has a metal thread,

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.210
which fits onto a tube attached to an icing bag.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.120
All pipes are interchangeable.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.820
The bag is made from a waterproof material available from any drapery store.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.120
To fill the bag with icing,

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.320
take a spoon for off the prepared royal icing and put it in your 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.720
not too much for your findings.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.820
The handle.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.620
I grew up in kabaddi bashing again with the damn cross.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.420
Now we're ready to commence at decorative work.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.140
Roses are always fascinating on cakes,

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.920
and these are brought up on toothpicks through that pickle pikey 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.320
around and around a toothpick with a half circle movement.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.320
Build the pickles up,

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.370
one by one with and relaxing a little firmer 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.220
than you have for other pipe work on the plate.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.320
Allowed to dry.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.440
And then put it on too great center of the cape is a letter shape 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.120
we made previously on an upturned petty case.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.320
And around this we'll put a circle off these made roses which are now quite 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.820
dry.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.060
Apply a little icing to the back of each rose and make a circle of 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.740
these roses around the lecher shape in the center of the case.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.640
Same royal icing is used for this.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.240
As for your other decorative work.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.140
Now the plane writing too.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.140
Well put.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.940
I couldn't around the side of the case.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.890
In a plane school up.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.540
True writing pipe at about inch intervals 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.270
i like.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.040
Simple.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.610
Yeah,

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.300
decorative effect around your cape.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.340
When you become more experienced,

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.640
maybe you can have a double scull up around the outside.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.140
Small trails or tender or through a plane rocking you?

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:17.980
I asked,

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.040
baste it intervals around the center ornament.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.500
I don't like to hysteria car.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.940
Just a simple little flip of the wrist.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.340
Now for the leaves through a special lead pipe with the green icing 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.540
a few little leaves between the roses.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.990
Please circle and you have the center of your case.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:45.710
Yeah.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.390
This perhaps is the most difficult and requires a little.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.960
We call it the shield and for we use to stop a 

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.940
large star for a bigger cake.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.810
The smaller star for will,

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:02.110
say,

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.140
a half pound cake.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.840
This joins the cake to the board and gives a decorative finish to the 

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:09.840
whole of the case.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.920
Charity is finished and ready to take the table.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:18.440
Uh,

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:18.750
no,

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.410
no kids.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.250
Diane's cake.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.250
So let's put some candles on.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:24.830
The soft,

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.840
pliable icing that we put on beginning is quite satisfactory as 

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.120
a base for your candle.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.840
Stand easily and firmly in this fund.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.150
Are the state party and waiting for the cake here in tears with you,

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.210
campbell's.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.750
Dying sun excited.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.760
You're going to blow the map.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.450
Missed one.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:01.670
No,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.850
that's not bad luck when she has the money to make a lovely case like 

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.150
match the five issue of woman's day and homes.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.810
You'll get full instructions for making and decorating.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.100
They use novelty cake.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.750
The street barrow cake is a fruitcake.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.540
It's decorated with scraps of funding.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.630
Place in the shape of vegetables.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.150
Fruits.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.190
Comfy.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.620
Dempsey is a fruit cake covered with funding paste marked on the 

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.250
wall.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.490
Holloway flex for the arms and legs and funding place for his head.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:38.830
Here's a pretty kate,

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:39.590
mary mary.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.850
Quite contrary from a nursery,

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.050
ron.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.580
And it's a transfer patterns picked out with a plane.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.000
I sing,

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:47.350
too.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.860
Another version of the rose cake.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.350
This time a square one and the edging call upset doctor,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.450
we used a few more roses on the corner this time.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.570
The great kate grapes and built up on this cake.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:09.450
We're not going to,

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.040
and the leaves were made more interesting with bran icing.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.050
Put in with the green.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.050
This gives a very good thing.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.100
No.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.100
