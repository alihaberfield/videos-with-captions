00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.900
No.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.050
You know where cambodia is?

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.200
I must admit,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.850
when i learned that we were calling there on our trip,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.710
well,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.990
i had to look it up on a map.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.750
No.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.260
And i've found that it's located in southeast asia.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.790
Don't ask me what they call this game again.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.890
Even pronounce it.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.130
It looks difficult to play,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.980
doesn't well.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.550
Me.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.680
Just a zeon.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.660
Every other country leaving school is about the best part of the day.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.790
But the arrival home is quite different from ours.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.750
No russian inside to raid the biscuit tin simply.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.330
Meet my friends.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.850
And from first thing the boys do is to check on their pets 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.230
once again.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.910
Why did from from my house,

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.960
okay.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.440
No.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.030
Him.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.070
You know,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.650
it's not so different from home with that before play time.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.590
Some chores.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.220
The car has to be loaded with rice plants or right shooters they call,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.670
then off to the fields.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.400
Sure it takes you quite a while to get way.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.240
Want to go?

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.030
But the water buffalo was strong and dependable.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.690
With stubble.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.250
Rice is a very important item in cambodia as his sugar and 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.600
rubber,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.230
and here the neighbor's air bomb and prom working in the rice paddies.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.590
It's very hard work.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.590
Rice has to be planted underwater.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.630
Hi dried it myself.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.320
But all i did was get wet,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.960
freed and a back.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.030
Today,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.690
a very special day for our two friends,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.690
so maybe they're working a little harder than usual.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.130
Sooner the job's done,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.950
the sooner they can be.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.660
No.

00:04:10.168 --> 00:04:13.058
I suppose when you go off to play you,

00:04:13.058 --> 00:04:13.868
why the war?

00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:14.488
Right?

00:04:14.488 --> 00:04:15.028
A baikal,

00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:15.938
maybe wrong escape.

00:04:16.728 --> 00:04:17.938
But here in encore.

00:04:17.938 --> 00:04:18.258
What?

00:04:18.948 --> 00:04:19.738
Once again,

00:04:20.198 --> 00:04:21.598
they do things differently.

00:04:22.318 --> 00:04:23.238
See what i mean?

00:04:38.768 --> 00:04:39.688
I told you earlier.

00:04:40.728 --> 00:04:42.638
Special day for armand prom.

00:04:43.168 --> 00:04:43.998
So it is.

00:04:45.028 --> 00:04:47.798
They're on their way to visit the temple of angkor wat.

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:49.168
This,

00:04:49.168 --> 00:04:51.138
along with palaces and monuments.

00:04:51.628 --> 00:04:55.448
It was built by the kind of warrior kings more than one thousand years ago.

00:04:56.928 --> 00:05:00.478
It's only within the last century that the rooms were rediscovered,

00:05:01.388 --> 00:05:05.738
and they're still in the process of being restored to their former magnificence.

00:05:08.578 --> 00:05:11.168
Apart from the opportunity of visiting the temple,

00:05:11.828 --> 00:05:14.568
there's yet another reason for the boy's excitement.

00:05:18.868 --> 00:05:18.928
No.

00:05:30.168 --> 00:05:34.638
And here it is in their beautiful costumes of red and gold,

00:05:35.128 --> 00:05:37.898
we see the fame royal palace dancers.

00:05:49.628 --> 00:05:49.838
Look.

00:05:59.828 --> 00:06:00.138
Look,

00:06:00.728 --> 00:06:00.868
okay?

00:06:06.484 --> 00:06:06.604
Okay.

00:06:28.034 --> 00:06:28.094
No.

00:06:40.584 --> 00:06:45.494
I'm sure arm and prom would be quite happy 

00:06:45.494 --> 00:06:47.294
to stay until the dance is finished.

00:06:48.184 --> 00:06:48.464
What?

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:49.444
Unfortunately,

00:06:49.444 --> 00:06:50.244
it's getting late,

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:54.484
and i know what these two elephants who have decided it's time for dinner.

00:07:22.684 --> 00:07:24.394
For arm and prom.

00:07:25.124 --> 00:07:25.854
You and me.

00:07:26.684 --> 00:07:28.034
I'm sure you'll agree.

00:07:29.054 --> 00:07:32.824
It's being quite a day in cambodia.

00:07:46.684 --> 00:07:46.914
All right?

00:07:46.684 --> 00:07:46.914
