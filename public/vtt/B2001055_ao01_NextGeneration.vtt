00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.020
My father came to australia from sicily,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.620
italy,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.120
in nineteen fifty two.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.560
He married my mother by proxy in nineteen fifty five,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.960
and she arrived not long after,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.780
even though i was born in australia in the light fifties,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.960
being in a family only speaking italian,

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.090
it was difficult for me to understand english when i started school.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.770
After my first few days of school,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.750
my parents were asked to come to school and respect to the teacher.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.890
Because mum didn't speak any words of english dead kind.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.680
It was asked why his daughter did not speak english.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.970
Being the only child from a non english speaking family made me feel 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.600
different and isolated from the other children.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.180
At school,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.990
however,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.370
a strong went on.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.260
I picked up the language and completed my school years.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.260
Deads parents arrived in australia in nineteen sixty three and lived with us for a 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.370
little while in the same year.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.040
Dead brought air first tv,

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.390
so i had windows into two different worlds.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.000
Around the age of ten years,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.280
i was asked to go with my grandmother to the doctor to translate.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.330
To me,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.210
it was boring,

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.130
sitting and waiting at the doctor's bruce i was often asked to go with 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.710
family members to see doctors and specialists as i was the eldest and 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.690
understood best.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.190
Sometimes i wonder if i said the proper thing in relation to their endless 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.140
well.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.710
Was it like a game?

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.890
If tony's whispers,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.280
i was a child,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.330
go between in an adult world.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.500
As my school years came to an end in the country,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.150
there were not many opportunities to continue studies.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.730
It worked in the local supermarket for a while.

00:02:15.018 --> 00:02:19.988
Not in seventy six arm atomic sis liana and in june nineteen seventy seven 

00:02:20.038 --> 00:02:20.728
we were married.

00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:23.778
I came to cover and worked with my husband.

00:02:24.588 --> 00:02:25.788
We have four children,

00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:28.158
three sons and one daughter of children.

00:02:28.158 --> 00:02:30.928
Grew up and completed the school studies likely.

00:02:31.138 --> 00:02:33.408
Our sons have studied and worked on the family.

00:02:33.408 --> 00:02:33.888
Watch it.

00:02:35.478 --> 00:02:38.348
Her daughter said she would like to go to university.

00:02:38.878 --> 00:02:41.038
The father said he would think about that.

00:02:41.258 --> 00:02:45.258
I said that my daughter was getting the opportunity i did not have been.

00:02:45.258 --> 00:02:47.568
If she had the scores to enter university,

00:02:47.578 --> 00:02:49.448
i would be happy for her to go.

00:02:49.518 --> 00:02:53.688
But thank god she was admitted to university and that her dead agreed.

00:03:09.032 --> 00:03:13.582
We owe.

00:03:09.032 --> 00:03:13.582
