00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.260
Building has bean mankind's continuous task since he ceased to be a cave dweller.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.490
If erecting this type of structure has its hazards for the primitive tradesmen,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.750
how much more complex other hazards for the builder of today?

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.280
For this reason,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.140
the department of labor and industry has created a code of regulations to assist in accident 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.850
prevention.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.500
Accident prevention begins of the tough management has a vital role in the business of 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.450
curbing the accident rate in a rapidly developing industry.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.950
Safety procedures must be studied and applied safety equipment designed 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.110
and installed.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.370
For example,

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.330
this iron clad signaling unit for hoist latest of its type we'll increase the safety 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.450
factor of vertical transport equipment.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.770
Instructions to the foreman should leave no doubt that safety regulations must be adhered to.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.130
Forman are obliged to insist on safety regulations and,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.830
more important,

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.850
still to see that they're carried out.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.770
And the workmen himself is just is responsible for keeping to the rules.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.050
That means safety for him and his mates.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.410
The first and most obvious requirement is good housekeeping.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.630
This site is an excellent example of tidiness,

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.540
which in turn means less likelihood of accident on all floors.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.290
Good housekeeping is reflected in the avoidance of debris on work waste and proves 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.510
that the general foreman is doing a good job.

00:02:04.408 --> 00:02:05.318
Small things count,

00:02:05.328 --> 00:02:05.618
too.

00:02:06.108 --> 00:02:07.498
When form work is stripped,

00:02:07.688 --> 00:02:11.008
nails should be bent over to prevent possible injury from walking on them.

00:02:12.208 --> 00:02:14.278
Dangerous to workers with normal footwear,

00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:17.618
disastrous characters who choose to walk around like this.

00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:23.248
Stairways are danger spots in construction work like this.

00:02:23.468 --> 00:02:28.268
They invite accident because there is no guarding against paul but fence like 

00:02:28.268 --> 00:02:28.698
this,

00:02:28.708 --> 00:02:32.568
with former two rails melted to form two uprights and a height of three foot six,

00:02:32.858 --> 00:02:36.318
they form a fish and safeguards where a person could fall more than six feet.

00:02:38.288 --> 00:02:39.288
Tubular steel is,

00:02:39.288 --> 00:02:39.738
of course,

00:02:39.758 --> 00:02:41.708
an excellent substitute for timber fencing.

00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:47.518
But keep stairs clean of debris.

00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:49.018
Good housekeeping.

00:02:49.028 --> 00:02:50.558
Especially important here.

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:55.698
Fighting is important,

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:56.778
even though fenced,

00:02:56.938 --> 00:02:58.618
you can miss your footing in a half life.

00:03:00.308 --> 00:03:01.358
But with adequate life,

00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:03.448
the danger of falling is largely eliminated.

00:03:07.308 --> 00:03:10.318
A lift well can be a fatal trap in some circumstances.

00:03:10.858 --> 00:03:13.568
This one is properly guarded by rail and tow board.

00:03:14.908 --> 00:03:19.018
But there was an occasion when a workman borrow the guard rail 

00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.018
and didn't put it back.

00:03:24.608 --> 00:03:26.808
The builder had failed to provide proper lighting,

00:03:27.308 --> 00:03:28.378
and later in the day,

00:03:28.618 --> 00:03:32.318
a workmate mistook the lift well for the stairway and fell to his death.

00:03:33.108 --> 00:03:35.218
This actually happened is not fiction,

00:03:35.908 --> 00:03:36.718
but unhappy things.

00:03:39.108 --> 00:03:43.758
The man who borrowed that board has an ugly memory to live with for the rest of his life.

00:03:49.008 --> 00:03:53.578
The human head is not designed to take hard knocks and work on a building project with an 

00:03:53.578 --> 00:03:55.548
unprotected head is asking for trouble.

00:03:56.908 --> 00:03:57.718
Safety helmets.

00:03:57.728 --> 00:04:01.918
Just what their name suggests they should be one wherever there is danger,

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:06.088
not less than one inch clearance should be allowed between helmet and harness,

00:04:06.138 --> 00:04:09.508
and the chin strap should be used so the helmet will not fall or blow up.

00:04:10.364 --> 00:04:13.234
Notice also that there is good protection for the back of the head.

00:04:18.364 --> 00:04:20.344
This is a good argument for using your helmet.

00:04:21.024 --> 00:04:23.174
Anyone below could be killed by that brick.

00:04:23.824 --> 00:04:25.894
Some workers have been killed just like that.

00:04:26.454 --> 00:04:27.114
Look at this helmet.

00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:29.084
A brick fell fifty feet onto it.

00:04:29.724 --> 00:04:30.974
The where was not killed.

00:04:31.214 --> 00:04:34.244
But imagine what his head would have looked like as it wass.

00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:36.364
He was off work for a week with concussion.

00:04:38.424 --> 00:04:40.544
Excellent can happen so quickly.

00:04:41.224 --> 00:04:44.074
The captains are on the right is going off the job without his helmet.

00:04:45.424 --> 00:04:46.224
First upstairs,

00:04:46.224 --> 00:04:47.634
a bricklayer picks his tools.

00:04:52.784 --> 00:04:55.784
The bricklayer checks to make sure that all is clear below.

00:04:56.264 --> 00:04:58.144
But what's what he does with his mortarboard?

00:05:01.724 --> 00:05:04.384
If the carpenter had remembered to put on his safety helmet,

00:05:04.684 --> 00:05:06.334
he would have avoided a nasty accident.

00:05:09.554 --> 00:05:14.234
The risks of falling from the open sides of floors are considerable unless they're properly fence.

00:05:15.174 --> 00:05:16.984
In addition to providing safety,

00:05:17.284 --> 00:05:18.864
workmen have a feeling of security,

00:05:18.864 --> 00:05:20.434
which improves their standard of work.

00:05:21.494 --> 00:05:26.194
This building is of lift slab construction and is well fenced with timber guard rails and tow board.

00:05:26.924 --> 00:05:29.564
Former two handrails belted two former two uprights.

00:05:29.574 --> 00:05:31.724
Eight foot centers are required for guard rails.

00:05:31.724 --> 00:05:32.834
At the height of three foot six,

00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:35.834
the toe board is of number one timber.

00:05:38.824 --> 00:05:40.334
Are not e story buildings.

00:05:40.344 --> 00:05:42.214
Tubular steel is equally effective.

00:05:44.424 --> 00:05:47.034
And in this case the tote board is secured with steel clip.

00:05:50.724 --> 00:05:54.634
This fencing is not up to standard as the stanchions are too far apart.

00:05:55.524 --> 00:06:00.244
Better ways to leave two inch holes in the concrete at eight foot centers to take tubular steel 

00:06:00.244 --> 00:06:01.634
uprights with welded eyes.

00:06:02.824 --> 00:06:04.904
This type of steel upright is suitable for cattle,

00:06:04.904 --> 00:06:06.414
even warnings or surrenders,

00:06:06.504 --> 00:06:09.734
but always make sure those clamps crews are kept tight.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:17.184
Floor openings can be really dangerous box.

00:06:20.488 --> 00:06:22.898
This unsafe practice will stop dust,

00:06:23.348 --> 00:06:24.398
but it could be a death trap.

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:28.638
Ah,

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:28.958
well,

00:06:28.958 --> 00:06:29.368
cleated.

00:06:29.378 --> 00:06:32.298
Substantial shutter is the only thing that will make it safe.

00:06:32.718 --> 00:06:34.298
It cannot move sideways.

00:06:37.488 --> 00:06:38.978
Large openings are equally,

00:06:38.978 --> 00:06:39.398
hasn't it?

00:06:42.288 --> 00:06:44.998
But they ceased to be dangerous when god in this manner.

00:06:48.188 --> 00:06:50.568
This is a true story of an accident to a crane,

00:06:50.578 --> 00:06:50.998
jason.

00:06:53.438 --> 00:06:55.838
The crane chaser knows about the shuttered opening.

00:06:56.388 --> 00:06:58.278
He walks on it to deliver his load.

00:06:58.788 --> 00:07:01.488
His mate is interested in the opening for another reason.

00:07:06.638 --> 00:07:08.498
It's a first class disposal chute,

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:11.998
but he doesn't replace the shutter.

00:07:15.588 --> 00:07:20.298
The inevitable happened this time familiar with what he thinks is a covered hole,

00:07:20.788 --> 00:07:22.498
the crane chaser drops his load.

00:07:25.228 --> 00:07:27.248
Because there is insufficient damage under it.

00:07:27.738 --> 00:07:28.818
The slings jam.

00:07:29.088 --> 00:07:30.578
And in an effort to free the sling,

00:07:30.748 --> 00:07:33.158
he steps back onto a shutter that isn't there.

00:07:35.228 --> 00:07:37.798
This tragedy was caused by work made thoughtlessness,

00:07:38.318 --> 00:07:40.788
inadequate supervision and the chase is earned.

00:07:40.798 --> 00:07:45.628
Failure to use proper dunnit proper damage under the load would have 

00:07:45.628 --> 00:07:47.708
made the removal of the slings and easy matter.

00:07:51.348 --> 00:07:51.808
Hoist.

00:07:51.808 --> 00:07:52.298
Ours,

00:07:52.308 --> 00:07:53.088
if supported,

00:07:53.088 --> 00:07:55.578
are now designed for a height of five hundred feet.

00:07:55.758 --> 00:07:58.798
And if guide can be two hundred fifty feet high,

00:07:59.488 --> 00:08:02.958
this super duty hoist our is two hundred forty feet high.

00:08:03.688 --> 00:08:07.398
Post ties in recent years have been the locations of many fatal accident,

00:08:07.818 --> 00:08:10.298
and a considerable number of men have been disabled by choice.

00:08:12.888 --> 00:08:14.898
Higher buildings require larger voice,

00:08:15.368 --> 00:08:17.058
and these operated faster speed.

00:08:17.888 --> 00:08:20.598
This sort of thing can and has caused decapitation.

00:08:24.488 --> 00:08:24.788
Yes,

00:08:24.918 --> 00:08:26.468
just after a fatal accident,

00:08:26.689 --> 00:08:29.699
a man took this foolish risk on his way to the dressing room.

00:08:30.349 --> 00:08:32.699
It was only sheer luck that the horse driver saw him.

00:08:34.189 --> 00:08:38.099
There is no excuse for this man's failure to use the pivot of guard rails,

00:08:38.589 --> 00:08:41.899
but even a guardrail does not completely ensure against human carelessness.

00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:47.039
Falling objects or another hazard.

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:48.159
If the host is not made,

00:08:48.859 --> 00:08:51.099
there's trouble in store for anyone moving below.

00:08:52.789 --> 00:08:57.119
Remember that the hoist driver relies on signals that these are mistakenly given.

00:08:57.129 --> 00:08:58.199
Accidents may occur,

00:08:58.889 --> 00:09:01.499
but they can be prevented by taking proper precautions.

00:09:02.689 --> 00:09:07.249
A super intending inspector of the department of labor and industry points out the features off well 

00:09:07.249 --> 00:09:08.499
designed hoist equipment.

00:09:10.689 --> 00:09:14.099
A sheet metal box guard fully covers the motor and coupling 

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:20.099
the spur and pinion gear wheels a fully in case that both sides and at the top,

00:09:20.489 --> 00:09:23.299
this rule applies to all spoken toothed wheels.

00:09:25.689 --> 00:09:29.789
The hoist road leading from the top of the drum gives the correct pull onto the fixed break.

00:09:29.789 --> 00:09:31.739
Anchorage all ends,

00:09:31.739 --> 00:09:36.389
a revolving shocks and projecting keys must be guarded or shops and keys resist,

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:38.299
as in these nigga head wolfing drums.

00:09:42.989 --> 00:09:47.849
Timber or steel struts and head stock prevent movement on the winch frame should be bolted 

00:09:47.849 --> 00:09:49.599
securely to concrete foundations.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:51.949
The law.

00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:53.689
His diverting xiv is guarded,

00:09:53.989 --> 00:09:58.009
but it should be able to be seen by the wind woman in case the rope works off the sheet.

00:10:00.759 --> 00:10:02.639
The distance between the xiv and drum,

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:04.339
which is protected by guard rails,

00:10:04.589 --> 00:10:09.239
provided the correct fleeting angle so that the hoist probe will wind evenly on the drum.

00:10:09.939 --> 00:10:14.749
This angle should never exceed three degrees on a gn group drums the distance from 

00:10:14.749 --> 00:10:17.649
chief to drum is more than nineteen no.

00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:24.059
The hoist driver has overhead protection,

00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:26.999
but he should wear his safety helmet when he steps outside.

00:10:28.589 --> 00:10:33.099
Twelve gauge steel wire miss should enclose the tired of six feet above the tough loading point.

00:10:35.889 --> 00:10:36.549
Loading point.

00:10:36.549 --> 00:10:38.239
Gates should be of steel mesh,

00:10:38.299 --> 00:10:42.599
six feet high gate switches operator the lights in the winch mons cabin.

00:10:44.788 --> 00:10:45.058
Well,

00:10:45.058 --> 00:10:45.908
a gate is open.

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:50.558
The bell signal is cut off when the gates are closed.

00:10:50.558 --> 00:10:53.698
A green life tells the winch hman it is safe to operate the hoist.

00:10:57.188 --> 00:11:00.578
And unsafe act is immediately detected by the winds driver.

00:11:09.018 --> 00:11:10.478
In the erection of form work.

00:11:10.608 --> 00:11:13.198
Proper precautions will eliminate many dangers.

00:11:13.788 --> 00:11:14.568
If a person could.

00:11:14.568 --> 00:11:15.698
For more than ten feet,

00:11:16.088 --> 00:11:20.698
handrail must be fixed to the outer edges of the form work as soon as the decking is in position.

00:11:21.388 --> 00:11:23.308
Handrails protect all tradesmen,

00:11:23.508 --> 00:11:25.728
including the men placing country it in position,

00:11:25.948 --> 00:11:29.098
while a slab edge board is a practical substitute for a tow board.

00:11:32.288 --> 00:11:36.808
And rails are fixed by tubular steel to at least two adjustable steel tom's,

00:11:37.068 --> 00:11:40.398
with ninety degree couplers hard up against the underside of the form work,

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.498
while in this case timbers used to form the rails,

00:11:44.088 --> 00:11:46.428
a second lower rail gives additional safety.

00:11:46.648 --> 00:11:48.718
It'll stuff a man rolling under the handrail.

00:11:51.988 --> 00:11:55.748
One slip on a man working by this dangerous method is likely the fall.

00:12:00.468 --> 00:12:03.398
And from here we reminded that it's not the fall that hurt.

00:12:03.988 --> 00:12:04.898
It's the sudden stop.

00:12:07.938 --> 00:12:10.498
But working like this from scaffolding is quite safe.

00:12:14.658 --> 00:12:19.198
A spur scaffold should be used for forming up on stripping beam sides deeper than two feet.

00:12:22.388 --> 00:12:24.698
The rigor is a man with special problems.

00:12:25.088 --> 00:12:26.298
His job is difficult,

00:12:26.478 --> 00:12:31.308
but we've past the days when he was regarded as a man who could climb anywhere and with brute 

00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:33.648
strength for steel members into position.

00:12:34.518 --> 00:12:38.108
The rigors of the old days paid a heavy price in injured backs,

00:12:38.228 --> 00:12:39.198
hernias and the like.

00:12:45.528 --> 00:12:46.338
Even today,

00:12:46.716 --> 00:12:51.476
it is sometimes the practice to send a new man aloft on a trivial errand to see how well he can 

00:12:51.476 --> 00:12:52.026
climb.

00:12:52.916 --> 00:12:53.836
It's a senseless,

00:12:54.036 --> 00:12:55.026
dangerous practice.

00:12:56.816 --> 00:13:01.176
A man starting to climb under compulsion like this could easily be the victim of an 

00:13:01.176 --> 00:13:03.256
unintended but very riel accident.

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:07.226
His mates could be sending him on more than a climb.

00:13:21.016 --> 00:13:23.326
While they may regard his performance with interest,

00:13:23.816 --> 00:13:27.936
he's taking his life in his hands without the slightest justification.

00:13:40.466 --> 00:13:44.266
Will it be moral murder if he falls and 

00:13:48.566 --> 00:13:53.366
but scaffolding and lift regulations require that safe means of access must be provided to every 

00:13:53.366 --> 00:13:58.156
working place as the steel workers erected on access is built on a central 

00:13:58.156 --> 00:14:01.526
bishan so that the rigor can safely reach the level of which he has to work.

00:14:06.796 --> 00:14:09.026
Here is complete disregard of safety.

00:14:09.786 --> 00:14:12.526
This man may be taking a short cut to save time.

00:14:13.116 --> 00:14:15.026
Perhaps his employers encourage him to do it.

00:14:15.716 --> 00:14:20.706
Perhaps he just feels too sure of themselves whether a deep beams which cannot 

00:14:20.716 --> 00:14:24.426
be straddled a lifeline on safety built is a safe means of exit.

00:14:33.046 --> 00:14:37.326
This rigor demonstrates the safe way to move across steel beams in high places,

00:14:38.016 --> 00:14:39.326
feet on the bottom plan,

00:14:39.756 --> 00:14:41.026
hands on the tough one.

00:14:43.756 --> 00:14:46.026
There have been cases of riggers falling to their death,

00:14:46.816 --> 00:14:50.986
but our friend goes back to his job convinced then an accident could happen to him.

00:14:55.116 --> 00:14:59.536
Management and supervision must accept the prime responsibility for the workers under their 

00:14:59.536 --> 00:15:00.236
control.

00:15:02.771 --> 00:15:07.131
But each employee must in turn accept responsibility for his own actions.

00:15:08.021 --> 00:15:11.881
When the people working on the job really believed that accidents can happen,

00:15:12.151 --> 00:15:14.131
they will adopt safe working practices.

00:15:14.821 --> 00:15:15.211
Then,

00:15:15.211 --> 00:15:19.531
and only then will we be nearer to eliminating the full guy from the building 

00:15:19.531 --> 00:15:20.991
construction of the future.

00:15:25.521 --> 00:15:25.581
Yeah.

00:15:25.521 --> 00:15:25.581
